This directory contains some file's that are examples on how to use the
UiL-OTS psychopy utilities.

If you want to run these against the current version of uil_psychopy, than make
sure to set the PYTHONPATH to one directory below this readme. If you haven't
installed the UiL-OTS psychopy utilities, your program is going to crash
with an ImportError. Or even more dangerous, you are actually importing
the already installed version, so you are not running against the development
edition of the UiL-OTS psychopy utilities, but the system version.

Some IDE's e.g. pycharm are quite capable of putting the ROOT of this project
on the python path.
